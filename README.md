Project: Phrase anagram engine

A phrase anagram is an anagram of a given phrase or word, which can be made
of several words; e.g.:
“Vacation time” <=> “I am not active”

Your task is to develop a program that, given a phrase, will produce all its phrase
anagrams. You can use the following notes to make your program easier:

• The available words can be loaded from a simple text file, a word in each
line.
• Assume all possible words are contained in the file, so that no further
processing is necessary, e.g. plurals of words, inflected verb forms etc.
• You can stop the search after you have found n solutions.
• Only exact solutions are allowed: no letters can be left out.
• The resulting phrases do not need to make sense.
